  abstract  = "From 1991 to 2003, 2,954 Chaffinches Fringilla coelebs were
               caught and ringed, year?round, at Hilborough, Norfolk, England.
               The age and sex composition of Chaffinches varied between
               winters, but no systematic pattern was apparent. The age and sex
               composition of Chaffinches caught during winter did not vary
               significantly from that of Chaffinches caught during the
               breeding season. Chaffinch wing lengths and body weights did not
               vary significantly between seasons. Male Chaffinches had wings
               that were on average 6 mm longer than females and adult wings
               were on average 2?3 mm longer than immatures and juveniles. Male
               Chaffinches were on average 2 g heavier than females.
               Approximately 40\% of juvenile Chaffinches retained unmoulted
               greater coverts after their post?juvenile moult, retaining 1.47
               $\pm$ 0.04 and 1.67 $\pm$ 0.09 formales and females
               respectively. Compared to immature females, twice as many
               immature males retained juvenile greater coverts. Overthe period
               of study, Chaffinches showed relatively consistent annual
               productivity, with captures of between 1.5 and 2 times as many
               juveniles or immatures as adults during the months following the
               breeding season. The higher productivity in some years was
               notexplained by variations in average monthly temperature during
               the breeding season. The mean duration between initial and final
               capture on the study site was between 1.6 and 2.3 years, and the
               longest period between initial capture and last recapture was
               over ten years. Only 0.14\% of Chaffinches were recorded moving
               distances greater than 5 km from the site of capture, confirming
               the sedentary nature of the species. This study shows that few,
               if any, continental immigrants supplement the local Chaffinch
               population atthe study site in Norfolk.",
