  author   = "Marler, P",
  abstract = "Summary Two captive flocks of Chaffinches were organised in
              straight-line, peck-right hierarchies with males dominant over
              females, the results of fights being the same wherever they
              occurred in the aviary. Fights over food and over perches had
              similar results, and varied in frequency through the day in the
              same way. The diurnal variation could not be linked with that of
              other activities, including feeding and perching. All fighting
              appeared to be caused by one bird coming too close to another. In
              a flock of four birds, the two of low rank made shorter and more
              frequent visits to the food dish than the others. The two
              middle-ranking birds spent more time feeding than both the alpha
              and omega birds. Behaviour during fighting and at other times
              varied with rank. Experiments on the effects of starvation on
              fighting showed that males were more tolerant of females than of
              each other. A female would not press an attack home against
              another female until it showed signs of fleeing, but a male would
              attack another male however it behaved. Starvation reduced the
              tendency of subordinates to avoid dominant birds, and probably
              also avoidance responses to environmental stimuli. The
              nomenclature of hierarchies is discussed, and the evidence for
              the existence of peck-right hierarchies in wild flocks is
              questioned.",
